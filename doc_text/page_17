5Have Forecasters Learned to Use Yield Curve Information?
We regard the result that the simplecurve modeloutperforms professional  forecastersyield
atforecasting recessionsas very puzzling:One possible explanationis that forecasterswere
unawareof the predictive powerof the yieldcurve formuchofoursample,which startsat

As mentioned above, the early papers trumpeting the predictive power of the yield curvewere
already published o widely circulated around the start of this subsample. Therefore, economists
by then should have incorporated this information in their forecasts and the puzzling predictive
power of the yield curve model over that of the SPF should have vanished. The results for the
1987 sample are reported in the right-hand-most columns of Tables 1and 2.post-
In the post-1987 sample, the yield spread still contains predictive information that appears

quarters:Based on the first-final data, the yield spread forecasts are significantly more accurate
than the SPF forecasts in half of the cases of forecast horizons of three quarters and longer:The
results are even strongerthe advance data. The upward bias in forecasts is larger for bothusing
the SPFand the yield curve forecasts for this subsample, reflecting the reduced frequency of
recessions during this period relative to earlier decades.For horizons of three and four quarters;

that economists also failed to heed the information in thecurve inmaking GDP forecasts.yield
Specifically, the four-quarter-ahead forecasts fail the rationality testwhen the yield spread is
included in the regression.
The relative value of the yield spread versus the SPF for forecasting recessions in the post-
1987 sample can also be illustrated by examining the accuracy of the weighted average probability

the three different measures, of these weighted average forecasts at horizons of h = 0, 2, 4.For
