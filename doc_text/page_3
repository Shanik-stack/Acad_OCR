sion prediction literature.We provide new evidence on this issue by examining the information
content of probability forecasts provided by participants in the Survey of Professional Forecast-
ers(SPF) and compare these forecasts to real-time recession predictions based on thecurveyield
spread.As discussed in Croushore (1993) , SPF forecasts of GDP growth and inflation have been
found to perform well in forecast evaluation exercises:The SPF also asks panelists to estimate
the probabilities that real GDPwill decline in the quarter in which the survey is takenand
in each of thefollowing four quarters.These data have two advantagesas real-time recession
forecasts. First, unlike other surveys that occasionally ask questionson recessionprobabilities
(e:g: =the Bluesurvey) the SPF has asked these questions each quarter for nearly 40 years,Chip
providing atime series of real-time recession forecasts. Second; these forecasts should incor-long
porate all information available to professional forecasters and therefore provide better forecasts
of recessions than implied by the leading indicators and other forecasting methods that have
been found wanting in past forecast evaluations. Indeed, Lahiri and Wang (2006) analyzed the
forecast performance of the SPF probability forecasts for the current and the next quarter and
found them to contain predictive power. But, those authors did not compare these forecasts to
those from other models o look at forecast horizons beyond one quarter.
We find that the SPF probability forecasts are somewhat better at forecasting recessions in
the current quarter than forecasts fromasimple probit modelthe yield spread; however ,using
this   difference isnotstatistically significantatthe 5%level.Moreover , the SPF's relative
predictive power deteriorates at forecast horizons of one quarterormore_These findingsare
robust to alternative measures of forecast performance Evidently; the pessimistic assessment of
the ability of economists to forecast recessions holds for the SPF probability forecasts as well.
The forecasts from thespread model, basedon real-time estimates;aresignificantlyyield
more accurate than the SPF probability forecasts for forecast horizons of three and four quarters.
At shorter horizons, the yield curve spread model is not useful at predicting recessions and its
forecast  accuracy is statistically indistinguishable fromthose of the SPFThis finding that
the simple yield curve spread model dominates the SPFatlonger horizons isapuzzle for the
hypothesis that forecasters incorporate all available informationas discussed by Fernaldand
Trehan 2006) .We show that SPF forecasts of real GDP growth exhibit the same pattern, with
forecast errors highly correlated with the lagged yield spread.
We find that the puzzling dominance of the yield curve modelover the SPFforecasts has
