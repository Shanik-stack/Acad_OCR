6Conclusion
Aswitnessed by the public attentiontorecent pronouncements of probabilities of recession;
there isagreat deal of interestin predicting recessions.Nonetheless, economists have a very
spotty track recordof predicting downturns.One possible explanation is that recessionsare
simply unpredictable.But, this view is contradicted by evidence that the yield curve provides
useful information for forecasting future periods of expansion and contraction:In this paper,
we show that the yield curve has significant real-time predictive power for distinguishing be-
tweenexpansions and contractions several quarters out relative to the predictions of professional
macroeconomic forecasters.Indeed,we find thatasimple model for predicting recessions that
usesonly real-time yield curve information would have produced better forecasts of recessions
at horizons beyondtwo quarters than the professional forecasters provided.This conclusion
remains trueduring the past 20 years, despite the fact that the yield curve model's usefulness
has been widely known since the late 1980s.
Thereareanumberofpotential reconciliationsfor this puzzle.One  possibilityisthat
forecasters may have down-weighted the yieldcurve information becausesystematicallythey
underestimated the macroeconomic repercussions of changes in the stance of monetary policy as
proxied for by shifts in the slope of the yield curve: Indeed, the relationship between output and
interest rates is estimated very imprecisely and is subject to econometric difficulties that may
bias estimates of the interest rate sensitivity of output downward. Nonetheless, the longevity of
this puzzle makes one questionforecasters have notcaughton to this mistake.Finally; itwhy
is interesting to note that many times during the20 years forecasters have acknowledgedpast
