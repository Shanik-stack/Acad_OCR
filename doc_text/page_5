activity. For detailed discussion of the NBER methodology, see Diebold and Rudebusch (1992,
1996) .Basedon thismethodology; the NBER publishes a historical chronology of the monthly
dates of past businesspeaks and troughs, which delineate recessions and expansions.(Forcycle
a modern dynamic factor approach for measuring economic activity; see Aruoba, Diebold, and
Scotti, 2008.
The NBER businessdating methodology requires substantial judgment in itscycleapplica-
and the resulting chronology iswithout measurementerror_Diebold and Rudebuschtion,not
(1992) describe some of the uncertainty about the precise monthly dating of the general turns in
business activity; however ,even if oneaccepts the NBER dates of cyclical peaks and troughs as
stated, there remains some ambiguity about whena recession starts and ends.Specifically, the
and trough months could be classified as the first month of a recession and the first monthpeak
of an expansion, respectively;or as the last month of anexpansion and the last month of are-
cession, respectively. The latter convention, in which the recession starts in the month following
themonth and ends on the date of the subsequent trough month; is the more common onepeak
(e:g: =Diebold and Rudebusch 1989).(In contrast, the NBER's view is that thewhen theday
economy turns around is contained within theortrough month; so those months are blendspeak
of both recession and expansion phases )Afurther complication arises from the translation
of the monthly dates into designations of peaks and troughsataquarterly frequency,  which
weemploy inouranalysis because the SPF is quarterly.Sucha translationcan be done ina
variety of ways,andwe follow the most common convention (e.g:Estrella and Trubin 2006)
andassume thata recession starts in the quarter that directly follows the quarter containing
themonthand that it ends in the quarter containing the troughmonth:Our resultingpeak
chronology of quarterly NBER recessions and expansions is represented byabinary variable,
with a one for a recession quarter and a zerootherwise, which will be denotedasRNBERt: See
thewebappendix to this article for further details of this variable.We also obtained similar
dating of recessionsan alternative convention in whicha recession quarter was defined tousing
contain two ormore recession months orthe convention in Wright (2006) , in which bothusing
thequarter and trough quarterwerecounted as recession quarters, butwe do not reportpeak
those results here.
Forouranalysis,weemployasimple rule that links declines in real GDPto recessions.
Asnoted by the NBER (2003):"The NBERconsiders real GDPto be the singlemeasure
