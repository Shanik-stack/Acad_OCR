call the "R2 rule;'which defines a recession asoccurring if there are two consecutive quarters of
negative real GDP growth:In particular_we say that a quarter is in an R2 recession if real GDP
falls in that quarter and if either (or both) the previous and following quartersnegativepost
real GDP growthaswell.Columns seven through nine in TableA1 report the R2 datafor
the first-final, current vintage, and advance data, respectively:This definition of a recession is
often mentioned in the media, but in practice, it performs rather poorlyasa proxy for NBER
recession dates.Using any of the three vintages ofthe R2 rule appears too stringentadata,
criterion to provide amatch to the NBER business-cycle dating methodology. For example,good
applying the R2 rule to the first-final data produces only ten recession quarters that match one
of the 21 NBER recession quarters, with 11 quarters of missed recession signals. Perhaps most
problematic; the R2 rulethe first-final data completely misses the 1980 and 2001 NBERusing
recessions.The R2 rule produces only two false calls of recession quarters relative to the NBER
definition (in 1969 and 1991).Overallthe R2 rule gives a total of 13 quarters of incorrectthen,
recession signals.
