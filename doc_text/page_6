that comes closest to capturing what itmeansbyaggregate economic activity'The [NBER]
therefore places considerable weight on real GDP and other output measuresOf course,as in
any real-time analysis, the issue of which vintage of data to use is important, andwe consider
three different data seriesfor real GDP growth:The first series is the so-called66first-final"
data which is released about three months after the end of each quarter.This is our preferred
real-timemeasure of GDP.It incorporates a great deal of information about expenditures and
is areasonably accurate measure of GDP basedon themethodology in place at the timeThe
second is the latest revised estimates available as of February 2007. These data have been subject
to multiple revisions and, importantly incorporate significant changes in methodology; making
comparison of real-time forecasts to revised data problematic. The third is the "advance"data,
which is released aboutone monthafter the end of the quarter.At the time of publication of
these data,; several important source data are still unavailable, making these estimates subject to
greater measurement error than the "first-final" estimates.See the web appendix to this article
for further details on these data:
Astraightforwardrulefordefining recessions thatworks quitewell iswhatwe dub the
'Rl rule;'which simply defines any single quarter of negative real GDP growthas a recession
quarter.The associated binary variable of recession quarters is denotedasAvalue of oneRlt:
indicates that the growth rate of real GDPwasnegative in that quarter, otherwise the value
is zero.Applied to first-final data, the Rl rule produces 14 recession quarters that matchone
of the 21 NBER recession quarters; withseven missed calls of recessionThe Rl rule alsoonly
produces five false calls of recession (including one by a whisker in 1978.Q1).Therefore, there
are 12 total quarters of incorrect signals and the mix of missed calls is reasonably balanced.The
Rl rule has advantages in terms of simplicity and its direct connection to the survey questions
in the SPF (described below)andwe therefore use it for our analysis for the remainder of the
paper.
For comparison,we also consider the recession dates that one obtains by applying whatwe
call the "R2 rule;'which defines a recession asoccurring if there are two consecutive quarters of
negative real GDP growth:In particular, we say that a quarter is in an R2 recession if real GDP
falls in that quarter and if either (or both) the previous and following quarters post negative
real GDP growth as well:This definition of a recession is often mentioned in the media; but in
practice, it performs rather poorly as a proxy for NBER recession dates. Using any of the three
