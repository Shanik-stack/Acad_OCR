The wording of the specific survey question is very clear and has changed little over time,
and in 2007 it readas follows:
Indicate the probability you would attach to a decline in real GDP(chain-weightedbasis, seasonally adjusted) in the next five quarters.Write in a figure that may rangefrom 0 to 100 in each of the cells (100 means a decline in the given quarter is certain,i.e_100 percent, 0 means there is no chance at all, i.e.0 percent)
The mean probability forecast for quarter t that was reported in response to this questionasked

3.2SPF implied probability forecasts
Our second sequence of recession probability forecasts is derived from the real output forecasts
reported in the SPFWe use thismeasureprimarily as a check to see whether the SPF proba-
forecastsare consistent with the SPF real GDP forecasts.We use the median real GDPbility
forecasts for quarter t from the SPF in quarter th and the historicalerror variances associ-
ated with forecasts at various horizons to compute implied recession probabilitiesFortlt-hthe purpose of constructing the SPF implied probability forecasts;we havereplaced the fourPGDP
mlissing observations for the four-quarter-ahead real GDP forecasts (mentioned above) with the
corresponding three-quarter-ahead forecasts.Excluding these data entirely from the analysis
does not affect our results.
