endured, suggesting thateconomists in the survey failedto'learn"about the usefulnessof
the yield spread for forecasting recessions.In particular; the yield curve model dominates the
SPF forecasts inasample covering only the past 20 years.This finding is especially puzzling;
because the usefulness of the yield curve spread to predict output growth and recessions received
widespread attention among economists in the late 1980s.Indeed; in our analysis,we use a very
simple real-time model identical to that proposed by Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991),which
practitioners should have been aware of formost of the past 20 years:The simple yieldcurve
model still dominates the SPF forecasts at horizons of three and four quarters in most cases for
this shortersample.Even after the predictive power of the yield curve had been well publicized,
it appears that SPF participants did not incorporate all of the available yield curve information
into their forecasts of economicactivity:
The paper proceeds as follows.In the next section; we provide a simple definition of recessions

probability forecasts for these GDP-based recessions.In Section 4,we assess the accuracy of
these forecasts: In Section 5,we examine whether the evidence on the relative forecast accuracy
has changed over time; and we conclude with some speculation about possible resolutions to the
puzzle of the enduring relative power of thecurve for predicting recessions:yield
2Defining Recessions
As a firstit is necessary to define what constitutes a "recession. " The National Bureau ofstep,
Economic Research (NBER) , which has been dating recessions for almost 80 years, provides the
mostwidely accepted definition of a recession (NBER 2003):
Thus; in determining the dates of businesspeaks and troughs,the NBER does not rely oncycle
any single macroeconomic indicator; but instead examines a large collection of variables.These
individual series have idiosyncraticmovements but also display substantial comovement and
correlation, and the NBER selects the overall businessand trough months to bestcyclepeak
capture the general consensus among the various series of the high and low points in economic
