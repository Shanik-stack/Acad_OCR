in the transmission of monetary policy;a central banker may not attach much if any cost toa
false signal thata recession willoccur in the second quarter if one actually does occur in the
third quarter.In contrast,a market trader may attachahigh cost to a false signal with sucha
one-quarter miss in timing:  Obviously, like many other researchers before US, we cannot provide
clear guidance on this issue but only highlight it.
For this exercise,weuse the asymmetric weighting scheme of Elliot, Komunjer, andTim-
mermann(2005) and apply it to the MAE and MSE criteria.In the case of the SPF probability
forecast, the weights applied to each (absolute O squared) forecast error are given by:
Wt (SPF,h) = [& + (1 = 2a)I(RltPSPE< 0)];
where I('is the indicator function, taking the value onewhen the forecasterror isnegative
(i.e.=a recession does not occur) andzero when the forecasterror ispositive (i.e =arecession
does occur)_Avalue of & of 0.5 implies symmetric preferences.As seen in Figure 1, the current-
quarter SPF reported probability forecasts appearto track theoccurrences of Rl recessions
much better than the yield spread, but perform worse in periods when no recession occurs.This
suggests that the relative accuracy of the SPF' forecasts may improve withaweighting scheme
that places more weightonavoiding missinga recession when one does occur thanonavoiding
false predictions of recessions.For this,we examined values f & of 0.6 and 0.8_
Ourresults about the relative accuracy of SPF and yield spread forecasts are robust tokey
the assumption of asymmetric preferences of this type.Even with a highly asymmetric loss with
Q=0.8, the SPFforecastsarenevermore accurate than the yield spread forecasts at the 5%
level:The current-quarter SPF forecasts are more accurate than the yield spread forecasts at the
10% significance level, butfor the first-final data  Based on the MAE criterion; at forecastonly
horizons of three and four quarters, the yield spread forecastsaresignificantlymore accurate
than the SPFforecasts at the 5% level.Basedon the MSE criterion, the four-quarter-ahead
spread forecast is significantly more accurate than the SPF forecast at the 10% level. Theseyield
results hold for both the first-final and advance data:The high relative accuracy of theyield
spread forecasts measuredanasymmetric criterion is all the more remarkable given thatusing
these forecasts were basedon the very different LPS criterion
