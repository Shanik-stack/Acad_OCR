1Defining Recessions
Our chronology of quarterly NBER recessions and expansions is shown in the final column of
Table Al, witha one fora recession quarter anda zero otherwise.This binary variable will be
denotedasRN BERt:
Forouranalysis,weemployasimple rule that links declines in real GDPto recessions.
Of course;as in any real-time analysis, the issue of whichvintage of data to use is important.
The first three columns of TableA1 displays three data series for real GDP growth_The first
series is the s0-called"first-final" data which is released about three months after the end of
each quarter.This isourpreferred real-time measure of GDP. It incorporatesagreat deal of
information about expendituresand isareasonablyaccuratemeasure of GDPbasedon the
methodology in place at the timeThe second column, the numbers in parentheses; reports the
latest revised estimates available as of February 2007. These data have been subject to multiple
revisions and; importantly, incorporate significant changes in methodology; making comparison
of real-time forecasts to revised dataproblematicThe third column, the numbers in square
brackets, reports the"advance" data,  whicharereleased aboutonemonthafter theendof
the quarter.At the time of publication of these data, several importantsource dataare still
unavailable, making these estimates subjectto greater measurementerror than the first-final
estimates.
Astraightforwardrulefordefining recessions thatworks quitewell iswhatwe dub the
'Rl rule;'which simply defines any single quarter of negative real GDP growthas a recession
quarter.The associated binary variable of recession quarters is denotedasColumns fourRlt:
through six in Table Al report the Rl data for the first-final, current vintage, and advance data,
respectively:Avalue of one indicates that the growth rate of real GDPwasnegative in that
quarter , otherwise the value is zero.As shown in the table, the RI rule applied to first-final data
produces 14 recession quarters that matchone of the 21 NBER recession quarters,with only
seven missed calls of recession_The Rl rule also produces five false calls of recession (including
onea whisker in1978.Q1). Therefore, there are 12 total quarters of incorrect signals and theby
mix of missed calls isreasonably balanced.The Rl rule has advantages in terms of simplicity
and its direct connectionto the survey questions in the SPFandwe thereforeuse it forour
analysis for the remainder of the paper.
For comparison,we also report the recession dates thatone obtains by applying whatwe
