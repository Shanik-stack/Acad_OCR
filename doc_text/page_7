NBER business-cycle dating methodology:For example, applying the R2 rule to the first-final
data produces only ten recession quarters that matchone of the 21 NBER recession quarters,
with 11 quarters of missed recession signals  Perhaps most problematic, the R2 ruletheusing
first-final data completely misses the 1980 and 2001 NBERrecessions.The R2 rule produces
only two false calls of recession quarters relative to the NBER definition (in 1969 and 1991).
Overall then; the R2 rule gives a total of 13 quarters of incorrect recession signals.See the web

In this section;we  describe various alternative real-time probability forecasts of Rlrecession
quarters using the first-final data.Theseare basedon  informationfrom the SPFor froma

quarter since the fourth quarter of 1968, the SPF has asked its participants to provideEvery
estimates of the probability of negative real GDP growth in that quarter as well as probabilities
ofnegative growth in the current quarter and each of the next four quarters. The survey typically
was due by the middle of the second month of the quarter (in recent years, the due date has
been moved upaweek,to around the 7th of the second month of the quarter)_The number
ofrespondents has variedovertime, witha median of about 34_Fora detailed discussion of
the SPFsee Croushore (1993)_There are fourmissing observations for the four-quarter-ahead
probability forecasts, with the finaloneoccurring during the survey taken in the third quarter
of 1974.Because we allow for autocorrelation of residuals in thecomputation of standard errors
for OU1 forecast accuracy statistics, the missing observations would require US to drop sixofyears
data from our sample.Instead,wereplaced the missing observations on the four-quarter-ahead
probability forecasts with the three-quarter-ahead probability forecasts from thesame survey.
Our mainresults also hold ifwesimplythe six years of data for the four-quarter-aheaddrop
forecasts.
